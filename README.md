# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing video game sales data to uncover insights regarding trends, popular titles, and regional preferences. The analysis is performed using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Video Game Sales dataset, which includes sales data for video games across different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and others). The dataset contains various attributes, including the title, platform, genre, publisher, and sales figures.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
- Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format for analysis.
- Scaling: Standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.
- Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers using Z-scores.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance the dataset, such as average sales per region.
- Data Wrangling: Restructuring and organizing the data for better insights.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing sales trends, identifying popular titles, and understanding regional preferences.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- `matplotlib`: For basic plotting of graphs.
- `seaborn`: For creating advanced statistical plots.
- `plotly`: For creating interactive plots.
- `scikit-learn`: For preprocessing techniques like encoding and scaling.
- `scipy`: For statistical functions such as calculating Z-scores.
